In Fall 2022, I helped develop a [custom Maya plugin][contactedit] for posing and animating hands using contact regions on hands and other surfaces, as part of a research project at CMU.

I tested different ways of visualizing the contact patches in Maya (such as with spheres, as shown in the video), and experimented with implementing an analytical gradient variant of the plugin that did not end up making it into the final paper.
