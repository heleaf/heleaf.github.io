#### <b> Courses I've taken at CMU </b>
<i>Inspired by <a href = "https://thenumbat.github.io/cmu/">these</a> <a href="http://weihang7.github.io/courses/">two</a> pages.</i> 

<b>Goal:</b> CS major, computer graphics concentration, animation & special effects or math minor. 

☆: Courses which I especially enjoyed and/or thought were worth taking. 

!: Courses which were particularly time consuming for me.

<h5><b>Fall 2021 (Preliminary)</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>TA: 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming & CS</li>
    <li>15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems</li>
    <li>15-210 Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
    <li>21-325 Probability</li>
    <li>60-220 IDeATe: Technical Character Animation</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Summer 2021</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>CMU Institute for Software Research REUSE: <a href = "http://www.penrose.ink/">Penrose</a> Research Intern</li>
    <li>MIT Summer Geometry Institute Tutorial Week</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Spring 2021</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>☆ ! TA: 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming & CS</li>
    <li>☆ 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation</li>
    <li>☆ 15-150 Principles of Functional Programming</li>
    <li>☆ ! 21-268 Multidimensional Calculus</li>
	<ul>
 	 <li>Pretty challenging, as it was my first time taking a multivariable calc course. Some proofs with matrices and a little bit of real analysis. I think this course (or 21-269) is good for building a foundation for mathier subfields in graphics (differential geometry, optimization).</li>
	<li>Prof. Fanhui Xu was a great lecturer and super encouraging.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>73-102 Principles of Microeconomics</li>
    <li>02-261 Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory</li>
    <li>05-120 Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction</li>
</ul>

<b>Workload:</b> moderate - heavy

<h5><b>Fall 2020</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>☆ 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming & CS</li>
        <ul>
            <li>! Made <a href="https://heleaf.me/code/isometrism/">Isometrism</a> as my term project. Incorporating some 21-241 lecture material (change of basis, perspective rendering) was cool.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>☆ ! 15-151 Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science</li>
    <li>☆ 21-241 Matrices & Linear Transformations</li>
