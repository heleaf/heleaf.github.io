<h4><b>Notes on courses I've taken at CMU</b></h4>
<i>Heavily inspired by <a href = "https://thenumbat.github.io/cmu/">these</a> <a href="https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/">two</a> pages.</i> 

<b>Goal:</b> CS major, aspiring computer graphics concentration. Also considering a minor in either animation & special effects or math. 

<b>Context:</b> I came into CMU with a shaky programming background (had a terrible AP Java teacher in HS, learned some Python on my own) and an okay math background (studied a little bit of competition math, did fine in AP/IB math classes).

☆: Courses which I thought were worth taking and/or especially enjoyed.

<h5><b>Fall 2021 (Preliminary)</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>TA: 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming & CS</li>
    <li>15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems</li>
    <li>21-325 Probability</li>
    <li>16-385 Computer Vision</li>

</ul>

<h5><b>Summer 2021</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>CMU Institute for Software Research REUSE: Penrose Research Intern</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Spring 2021</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>☆ TA: 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming & CS</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Teaching recitation/lab, mentoring students during TP season, and managing Piazza were all much harder than I expected. I prepped way too much, spent way too much time grading, and messed up more than I can count. I'm grateful I was able to learn a lot of things from vet TAs and my own wack teaching experiments, though.</li>
            <li>Favorite parts (not exhaustive): grading/teaching with other TAs, helping students during OH, giving a mini-lecture on 3D graphics, working on 112 puzzlehunt.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>☆ 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming hws were fun when I wasn't trying to finish them 1 hour before the deadline. Labs were chill and sometimes fun (though that depended on having a good group). Recitations were nice when I didn't sleep through them (rip). Lectures were taught very well, but the in-class activities stressed me out (also I kept forgetting to do them).</li>
            <li>"Exams felt like a fever dream" pt 2. On a completely unrelated note, I also did them pretty late at night.</li>
            <li>If I wasn't TAing (or procrastinating), I would have tried to do the bonus hw problems.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>☆ 15-150 Principles of Functional Programming</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Functional programming is really elegant, and thinking recursively is fun. A lot of the hw/lab problems were super cool, I was just unfortunately very dead while doing both. Although, working together with one of my suitemates on the last few homeworks was a blast :)</li>
            <li>TAs are probably on par with 15-151 staff, they were amazing in their explanations, and prepared so much extra practice/resources for us.</li>
            <li>Prof. Erdmann was a fun lecturer, Prof. Crary explained concepts quite clearly. Watching in-person blackboard lectures remotely was very painful, though (could not focus).</li>
            <li>Exams were big time crunch. Also got carried by a (big?) curve on midterm 2 bc we all died.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>☆ 21-268 Multidimensional Calculus</li>
        <ul>
            <li>More proof-based than 21-259 (although it covers the same content), with a little bit of real analysis sprinkled in (but not on the level of 21-269). I realized I didn't learn calculus very well in HS while taking this course, and that my intuition for certain aspects of it is pretty bad. Also had to learn trig sub on my own since I didn't take MVC in HS, which was wonderful and not stressful at all.</li>
            <li>Prof. Xu explained things pretty intuitively and visually when she could. She was also very accomodating and encouraging during lecture/OH, which was quite motivating (to the point where I didn't give up after completely failing two quizzes in a row and getting discouraged from doing more rigorous math).</li>
            <li>I was highkey scared of my recitation TA, but he explained things quite well and gave us some nice strategies for solving problems.</li>
            <li>I should have spent more time on the homeworks, because the problems were actually cool when I wasn't stressed out about finishing them in time.</li>
            <li>Made friends with some MCS dudes in the in-person recitation, which made comiserating over quizzes/doing hws a lot more bearable. Hopefully we can get a stuffed minion for Prof. Xu in the fall. </li>
            <li>Overall I'm very happy with how much I learned in this course. That means more pure math for me next semester, I guess...</li>
        </ul>
    <li>73-102 Principles of Microeconomics</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Prof. Best is really nice and funny, he explains things pretty intuitively. I didn't have much interest in econ to begin with, so I was very sad while doing psets (shoutout to my suitemates for carrying me). Also highkey gave up on the final, woops.</li>
            <li>Overall not a bad option for the SCS constrained category 2 gened.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>02-261 Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Very chill class, did some experiments in person and computational analysis for assignments. Prof. McDade is really nice and accomodating. </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good option for the SCS lab requirement.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>05-120 Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This was an A3 mini. More soft-skill than I expected, which led to me deciding to not primary major in HCI. Prof. Ogan is really nice though.</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
<b>Other:</b> dropped a project with GCS in the middle of the semester :(

<b>Workload:</b> heavy, death in the 2 weeks before finals

<b>Notes:</b> Living on campus was amazing. This probably would have been a moderate-heavy workload, but TAing (especially during TP season) pushed it to heavy-death. Overslept many live lectures and used many late days in the second half of the semester; I was not able to spend as much time as I would have liked doing on the content/hw I found interesting in 122/150/268. Overall I'm happy I learned a lot, but I definitely could have managed my time better. Also had to deal with a couple of [now mostly resolved] serious personal issues, which definitely did not help the stress.

<h5><b>Fall 2020</b></h5>
<ul>
    <li>☆ 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming & CS</li>
        <ul>
            <li>My programming confidence and fluency improved so much after taking this class. The problem-solving, debugging, and recursion I learned in 112 helped greatly in 122 and 150.</li>
            <li>First few weeks of recitation were slow given my coding background, but content sped up and got harder rather quickly. Hws were always really fun to do. I made friends and had a lot of fun during quizbowl and Hack112. I also gained some insight into teaching and had fun doing a bit of peer tutoring.</li>
            <li>Prof. Kosbie is a really fun, supportive, and engaging lecturer. Prof. Taylor is really kind and reassuring to talk/listen to. Their advanced lectures were really eye-opening, informative, and fun (covered material connected to 15-151, 21-241, 15-122, and 15-150!) They also gave life/job/internship advice and cool stories; Prof. Kosbie was kind enough to write and send a reccomendation letter to a bunch of REU programs I applied to, which I'm 99% sure is why I got offered any research positions at all.</li>
            <li>Made <a href="https://heleaf.me/code/isometrism/">Isometrism</a> as my term project. I learned a lot about 3D graphics, project ideation/iteration/management, and coding in general. Super super fulfilling to have something I envisioned myself come to life, although it did stress me out quite a bit in the last week of making it.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>☆ 15-151 Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Mackey is a really funny and interesting lecturer. He's also very supportive and understanding (source: camped his OH for pset hints & life/class advice).</li>
            <li>TAs are probably one of the best staffs at CMU-- explained things intuitively during recitation, held in-depth & applicable review sessions, made a lot of practice exam materials for us, carried me during OH.</li>
            <li>Camped TA OH quite a bit after the first pset grades came out. Also learned that you can't BS psets less than 2 days before the due date.</li>
            <li>Exams felt like a fever dream, and were quite a bit of hit-or-miss for me.</li>
            <li>In general I did a lot better on the content I had some prior (competitive math) experience in, but overall the course content is taught well and vital for every other CS/math class.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>☆ 21-241 Matrices & Linear Transformations</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Prof. Offner is based. (really nice, explained things intuitively/visually, gave us reasonable/applicable hws/exams)</li>
            <li>I don't have great intuition for matrices & their structure, so I struggled to deeply understand a lot of the material. I was pretty happy with how much I learned, though. Matrices are cool!</li>
            <li>Really useful class for a lot of different math & CS fields, including graphics :)</li>
        </ul>
    <li>76-107/8 Writing about Data/Public Problems</li>
        <ul>
          <li>First year writing requirements, pretty boring and overall BS-able (had nice profs though).</li>
        </ul>
    <li>98-127 StuCo: Game Creation for People Who Want to Make Games</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This probably would have been fun in person, but everyone was pretty dead over zoom. The students teaching it were really nice and knowledgeable though.</li>
            <li>Could not focus on the project for this class while I had 3 other class/club projects going on, so ended up getting hard carried by my teammates (rip).</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
<b>Other:</b> worked on <a href="https://heleaf.me/code/liminal/">LIMINAL</a> with CMU Game Creation Society

<b>Workload:</b> moderate, heavy during 112 TP season

<b>Notes:</b> took classes remotely at home, which allowed me to study for certain classes when it mattered (although my mental suffered a bit). I probably should have taken 21-295 Putnam Seminar over the StuCo.
