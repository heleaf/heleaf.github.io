State machines are surprisingly simple but really applicable, I can immediatley think of a lot of games that I've seen or played that use that sort of framework for user-controlled character actions (ex. as in RPGs).

The kangaroos and piston-based animation in Jessica Hodgin's paper is also a simple idea but seems to be quite effective.

Monte Carlo being applied for simulation (after learning about it for rendering) is also cool to see.
