All the projects were super cool! The GPU fluid simulations were really neat, it makes me want to take 418 so I can learn how to program a GPU as well... The fracture MPM project was also neat and well-visualized (I wish I realized Taichi had a Python version of their library as well). The real-time rigging projects and the fire project were also super cool to see being demoed.
