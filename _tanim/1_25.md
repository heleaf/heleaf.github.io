The different types of inverses that can be used for the IK problem were all interesting to learn about (as well as their limitations). In practice, are there any other types of inverses that are commonly used in graphics? What kinds of limitations does the damping pseudoinverse have (despite the fact that it fixes some issues with the transpose and pseudoinverse)?

Some of the physics-based equations (ex. relating to torque, cross products, axes of rotation) were slightly confusing to me, probably because it's been a while since I've taken a physics class. But the physical motivation and explanations given for the construction of the J matrix / the Jacobian transpose were still helpful and interesting to learn about.
