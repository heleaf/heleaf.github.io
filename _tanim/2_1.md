I didn't expect to see minimum spanning trees appear in graphics (after mostly seeing it in algorithms and maybe systems classes...). 

For geometric skinning techniques, I've heard of linear blend skinning and dual quarternion blend skinning (although dual quarternion seems a lot more intimidating), but not cage-based techniques. 

Example-based techniques (blend shapes) are interesting as well (kind of an extension of LBS?). I wonder if they're commonly used for anything else in industry, aside from facial animation. 

I wonder if any biologists or biology background people have been roped into physics-based techniques where the tissues of the body are simulated.
