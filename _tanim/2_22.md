It was mentioned in class that non-convex objects can be handled more easily for collisions if split into multiple convex parts. I wonder if there's research that goes into determining how to best split an arbitrary non-convex object into convex pieces? 

Being able to apply one of acceleration or force for the constraint based method is also an interesting limitation I hadn't expected.
