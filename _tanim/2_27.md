These paper presentations make me want to take 15-418 or at least learn more about GPUs. They're so useful for speeding up different graphics algorithms (especially cloth simulation, it seems like).

Yarn-level cloth simulation is really cool. It really pays off to simulate cloth to that level of detail (even if it's really expensive), from the visual quality alone.
