It was super cool to be able to see how computer graphics research and techniques influence industry (ex. Disney, Pixar). I think a lot of the time research papers seem daunting or hard to understand, but seeing their impact on industry feels rewarding and motivating. 

Visiting the Motion Capture Lab seems like it could be cool. I don't have any experience in real time capture or the more robotics side of graphics, so I feel like I could potentially learn a lot in those areas. 

Actually, although it was also just something small that was mentioned, I would also be interested in learning more about how Nancy's student went from doing research to working on Pixar's Coco. It seems like a lot of people working at these big studios all took different paths to get there, and I always find these kinds of stories interesting.
