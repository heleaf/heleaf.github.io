Simulating cloth as springs is quite interesting to me. It's interesting to think of cloth in terms of a point in the cloth, and it's local neighborhood (springs). This sort of local perspective (rather than handling the entire cloth globally) seems to be quite common in graphics research in general. 

The friction models with the cones are also a new perspective that are pretty cool to me. It's so simple, but it seems to capture the behavior of different materials quite well. 

Cool to see how graphics research intersects with the world of fashion as well (ex. Marvelous Designer).
