It's interesting how ML has become more and more prevalent in graphics. (I see it being used for other subfields like rendering, in addition to animation.) The different ways that exist of looking at the same IK methods (ex. Jacobian vs. gradient perspectives) are also interesting. It kind of reminds me how in math, the same core theorems can be re-derived in many different ways.
