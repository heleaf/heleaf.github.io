I've never seen such a detailed hand model before (down to the veins and muscles as well...) I feel like this would be unlikely to be included in film or games, but definitely seems like it'll impact the medical professionals positively. I wonder if our understanding of anatomy will ever get to a point where these types of images and rigs can be used to help inform medical professionals on how to diagnose different movements.
