The motion doodles project is really cool. It's so wholesome how the author created it for his kid. I didn't expect to see anything super involved or interesting with 2D animation, so this was a nice surprise. 

I haven't seen much work with tetrahedral meshes, are they mainly just used for finite element simulation? 

The heightfields project was also really cool. I think I was impressed because the idea seemed quite simple, but there was a lot that the student did to study it under different circumstances, and heightfields themselves seem to be more expressive than I initially expected as well.

Snow seems really cool to maybe try to tackle as a final project. The fact that the technique mentioned (MPM) was also used in actual movies really interests me. I'm leaning towards that as a final project idea.
