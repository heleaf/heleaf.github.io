Still thinking about fleshing out more concrete goals and resources for my final project idea, but as of now I'm still leaning toward simulation with MPM. Looking at the 2016 SIGGRAPH course notes for this, it seems like MPM can also be used to simulate toothpaste, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, jello, etc (in addition to snow). Trying to utilize MPM, or different variants of MPM (since there seem to be quite a few different variations) on these different materials seems interesting. 

Currently also looking into whether there are any papers on rendering materials using MPM. I think this could be a cool extension and could make for cool demos, but I'm not sure how difficult / feasible this would be, considering I'm also not sure what engine I want to be testing my implementation in (maybe Unity, or AMC Viewer?) 

I could also just try out a lot of different variations of MPM, and other simulation methods (FLIP, position based fluids, etc.). These are all interesting to me, and it would be interesting to compare performance, efficiency, complexity, etc.
