Exploring different skinning algorithms seems interesting (the implicit function skinning mentioned, and maybe also dual quarternion), although if it's too much for mini project 1 I think I would also be interested in looking into different IK algorithms. One idea I've just thought of for mini project 1 would be to run different skinning algorithms on walk cycles that I've animated. 

I've done some technical character animation before, but not with faces. It would be interesting to learn about how techniques for faces (ex. blend shapes) differ from traditional animation techniques like IK.
