Boid's is cool to see here as a social force-related algorithm, since I've usually viewed it as flocking behavior mainly for birds. Studying social forces in conjunction with computer graphics is also an unexpected intersection of graphics with another field that I didn't expect to see. Panic simulations seem quite niche, but I didn't realize how well studied they actually are.
