It's interesting that Ants was the first time fluid simulation made such a big impact in the film industry (especially because that was not the main focus of the film). 

I wonder if graphics researchers who focus a lot on fluid simulation also tend to have a background in PDEs as well-- breaking down the Navier Stokes Equation into its parts makes it easier to digest, but I'm curious about how one would go about deriving it from scratch.
